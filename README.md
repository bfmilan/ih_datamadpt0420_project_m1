# **ih_datamadpt0420_project_m1**

## **Data:**

There are 3 different datasource involved:

- **Tables (.db).** [Here](http://www.potacho.com/files/ironhack/raw_data_project_m1.db) you can find the `.db` file with the main dataset.

- **API.** We will use the API from the [Open Skills Project](http://dataatwork.org/data/).  

- **Web Scraping.** Finally, we will need to retrieve information about country codes from [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Country_codes) website.

---

## **Challenge 1:**

You need to create a **Data Pipeline** that retrieves the following table:

| Country | Job Title      | Gender (1) | Quantity | Percentage |
|---------|----------------|------------|----------|------------|
| Spain   | Data Scientist | Male       | 25       | 5%         |
| Spain   | Data Scientist | Female     | 25       | 5%         |
| ...     | ...            | ...        | ...      | ...        |
> **(1)** This attribute won't be the same for all students. See distribution bellow. 


**Your project must meet the following requirements:**

- It must be contained in a GitHub repository which includes a README file that explains the aim and content of your code. You may follow the structure suggested [here](https://github.com/potacho/data-project-template).

- It must create, at least, a `.csv` file including the requested table. Alternatively, you may create an image, pdf, plot or any other output format that you may find convenient. You may also send your output by e-mail, upload it to a cloud repository, etc. 

- It must provide, at least, two options for the final user to select when executing: **(1)** To get the table for every country included in the dataset, **(2)** To get the table for a specific country imputed by the user.

**Additionally:**

- You must prepare a 3 minutes presentation (ppt, canva, etc.) to explain your project (TAs will provide further details about the content of the presentation).

- The last slide of your presentation must include your candidate for the first **'Ironhack Data Code Beauty Pageant'**.
